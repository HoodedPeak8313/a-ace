## One day, I got incredibly bored and decided to make a parental-control client for my homeschool system
## This is not directly affiliated with anyone; this work is all my own
## I plan to release this when I feel like the first version is complete enough for release
## Details of release are to be determined, I do not know how I am going to release this project
## If you do not have an account with this schooling system it is kind of a useless program, but maybe I will release it open source (I don't know yet) and you can look at the code
# No code has been uploaded yet, just the website
